	- Qualsiasi oggetto nel mio [[Models/Type/Object Model]] che esiste anche come concetto nel [[Models/Type/Domain Model]]
	- Any object in my [[Models/Type/Object Model]] that also exist as a concept in my [[Models/Type/Domain Model]] I would call a *domain object*. In the previous example, `Restaurant`, `Order` and `Customer` would all be domain objects.
	- > Not every object in a system is a domain object. Some objects are *value objects*. A value object is an object whose *identity* doesn’t matter. Examples of concepts that would make sense as value objects rather than domain objects are phone number values or money values.
- ## Altro
	- The best definition of "domain object" I've found in literature is in Chapter 11 of [TimHoward](https://wiki.c2.com/?TimHoward)'s book [TheSmalltalkDevelopersGuideToVisualWorks](https://wiki.c2.com/?TheSmalltalkDevelopersGuideToVisualWorks) pp.379-381:
		- "a domain object is a logical container of purely domain information, usually represents a logical entity in the problem domain space ... In general, domain objects should know how to
			- recognize which [of their] references indicate aggregation and which ones indicate association
			- copy themselves
			- maintain business logic
			- compare themselves to other domain objects of the same type
			- facilitate other objects that choose to print or display them
			- conduct tests on their domain information"
		- To this list I would add
			- identify themselves
			- validate themselves
