	- The best definition of "domain object" I've found in literature is in Chapter 11 of [TimHoward](https://wiki.c2.com/?TimHoward)'s book [TheSmalltalkDevelopersGuideToVisualWorks](https://wiki.c2.com/?TheSmalltalkDevelopersGuideToVisualWorks) pp.379-381:
		- "a domain object is a logical container of purely domain information, usually represents a logical entity in the problem domain space ... In general, domain objects should know how to
			- recognize which [of their] references indicate aggregation and which ones indicate association
			- copy themselves
			- maintain business logic
			- compare themselves to other domain objects of the same type
			- facilitate other objects that choose to print or display them
			- conduct tests on their domain information"
		- To this list I would add
			- identify themselves
			- validate themselves
